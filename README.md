# Project Vinum Tutorials

Welcome to the Written Tutorials for Project Vinum. In lieu of creating an actual wiki for this mod, I will instead provide user-end documentation through a series of Written Tutorials on the github for each version. They will function just like a website, despite being nothing more than a collection of internal links and assets put into markdown files.

I will do my best to keep this up to date at all times. For this reason, there will be links to different "versions" of the Written Tutorial that will correspond with different stages of the current mods development.

# Wiki for Project Vinum
## Version alpha-0.1.0 (MMD-Jam 2020)
[Back to Main](https://github.com/boredhero/pv/blob/wiki/src-wiki/Main.md)

Welcome! In future version, this will have more pages, but for now, we will just show you guys how to get started, and explain a bit about what this very early alpha build of our mod does.

## Getting started

In this version of the mod, the amount of features added are very limited. For this reason, we will be going over how to get from 0 to everything this mod offers, and providing general information.

### Finding Agave

To find agave, you need to find your nearest large sandy area. This can be a beach or a desert. There you will find Agave plants.

You can harvest these to get **Agave (Item)** and **Agave Seeds**. Agave Seeds will allow you to right click on any sand or farmland block to plant a new agave plant to grow. You can also craft the agave item into agave seeds should you ever need any.

### Making Steel

For many of this mods crafting recipes, you will need a **Steel Ingot** and/or **Steel Nugget**. To make these, you will need to first craft a vanilla Minecraft Blast Furnace. Then, blast iron ingots and iron nuggets to get their respective steel items. Of course, you can always drop an ingot in a crafting table to get nine nuggets, and vice versa to turn nuggets into ingots.

# Wiki for Project Vinum
## Version alpha-0.1.0 (MMD-Jam 2020)
[Back to Main](https://github.com/boredhero/pv/blob/wiki/src-wiki/Main.md)

Welcome! In future versions, this will have more pages, but for now, we will just show you how to get started, and explain a bit about what this very early alpha build of our mod does.

## Getting started

In this version of the mod, the amount of features added are very limited. For this reason, we will be going over how to get from zero to having everything this mod offers, and providing general information along the way.

### Finding Agave

To get agave, you need to find the nearest large sandy area. This can be a beach or a desert. There you will find Agave plants.

You can harvest these to get **Agave (Item)** and **Agave Seeds**. Agave Seeds will allow you to right click on any sand or farmland block to plant a new agave plant to grow. You can also craft the agave item into agave seeds should you ever need any.

### Making Steel

For many of this mods crafting recipes, you will need a **Steel Ingot** and/or **Steel Nugget**. To make these, you will need to first craft a vanilla Minecraft Blast Furnace. Then, blast iron ingots and iron nuggets to get their respective steel items. Of course, you can always drop an ingot in a crafting table to get nine nuggets, and vice versa to turn nuggets into ingots. 

Additionally, both our ingots and nuggets are registered with Forge Tagging (the successor to Forge OreDictionary) so that you can use our nuggets and ingots with any recipes that support tagged items, and all of our recipes support tagged steel so all our recipes work with other mods tagged steel as well.

### Making Glassware

Obviously, booze needs to be stored. There are several glassware items that you will need to craft to use in crafting recipes and machine interfaces to make alcohol.

##### Fifth Bottle [Empty]

The first and most basic of these is the **Fifth Bottle [Empty]** which will be used to hold alcohol coming out of the distiller. Crafting is like this (Note that glass colors are unimportant and just there to show that any glass blcok can be used):

##### Pack Of Shot Glasses [25]

Secondly, you will need a **Pack of Shot Glasses [25]** to craft with so that you can drink your Tequila to get effects (more on those later...). The crafting recipe is simple, and supports all types of glass.

##### Margarita Glass & Required Ingredients

Thirdly, you will need to make a **Margarita Glass** for the one cocktail currently added by this mod. Unlike the other glass items, this is a little more involved. It will be replaced by a more elegant machine-based system in the future, but for now, there's 3 steps.

1. Craft a **Margarita Glass Mold** like so:

2. Make some **Molten Glass** by smelting any glass in a regular vanilla furnace like so:

3. Make the **Margarita Glass** by crafting the **Molten Glass** with the **Margarita Glass Mold** like so:

### Making a Barrel

Barrels have all kinds of uses. We will be using them for fermentation and aging in this mod. Currently, this is handled by the **Barrel** item and crafting recipes, but in the future, it will be replaced by a block and GUI system. Here's what you'll need to craft a barrel (Note the variety of wood just shows that you can use any planks you have available):

### Making a Pot Still

The pot still has a venerable history serving humanity in all its alcohol-reducing needs. These can be made out of copper or steel. Ours is made from steel. However, to make the **Pot Still Multiblock** you will first need to craft several items. Here is what you'll need and how to make it:
